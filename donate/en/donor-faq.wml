          <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>What is the Tor Project and what does it do?</strong></p>
            <p>The Tor Project’s mission is to advance human rights
            and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open
            anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting their
            unrestricted availability and use, and furthering their
            scientific and popular understanding. The main product of
            the Tor Project is Tor Browser, which enables people
            to browse the internet anonymously.  The Tor Project is a
            501(c)3 tax-exempt non-profit organization based in Boston,
            Massachusetts. It was founded in 2006.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Who works for the Tor Project, and what do they do?</strong></p>
            <p>Thousands people around the world actively support the
            work of the Tor Project, including developers, designers,
            relay operators, researchers, cryptographers, computer
            scientists, and privacy advocates, and most are not paid
            by the Tor Project. The paid staff of the Tor Project
            is very small: about 20 people in total. You can read
            about the core contributors to the Tor Project on our <a
            href="<page about/corepeople>"
            target="_blank">Core People page</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Who uses Tor?</strong></p>
            <p>The vast majority of Tor users are ordinary people who
            want control of their privacy online or people whose internet
            use is censored. Other Tor users are journalists, human
            rights defenders, domestic violence survivors, policymakers,
            diplomats, and academic and research institutions.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Can anyone use Tor?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes! Tor is free, and anyone can
            use it. To get started, you will need to <a
            href="<page projects/torbrowser>"
            target="_blank">download the Tor browser</a>. We
            offer instructions on how to download for <a
            href="<page projects/torbrowser>#windows"
            target="_blank">Windows</a>, <a
            href="<page projects/torbrowser>#macosx"
            target="_blank">Mac OS X</a> and <a
            href="<page projects/torbrowser>#linux"
            target="_blank">Linux</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>What kinds of people support Tor?</strong></p>
            <p>All kinds of people. Thousands of individuals have donated
            to support the Tor Project, and we have also received funding
            from a wide range of organizations including Google, the Ford
            Foundation, the Knight Foundation, Reddit, the U.S. National
            Science Foundation, the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
            Human Rights Watch, the Swedish International Development
            Cooperation Agency, the Federal Foreign Office of Germany,
            the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Omidyar Network, SRI
            International, and Radio Free Asia. People also support Tor in
            non-financial ways, for example by running Tor relays and exit
            nodes. In addition, everybody who uses Tor is helping to keep
            other users safe and anonymous, because the more people using
            Tor, the harder it is to identify any single individual</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>How does the Tor software work to protect people's anonymity?</strong></p>
            <p>Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around
            the Tor network, which is a distributed network of relays
            run by volunteers all around the world. If someone is
            watching your internet connection, Tor prevents them
            from finding out what sites you are visiting. It also
            prevents sites you visit from finding out where you're
            located. You can read more about how Tor works on our <a
            href="<page about/overview>"
            target="_blank">overview page</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>I would like to know more about how Tor works,
            what onion services are, or how to run a relay.</strong></p>
            <p><a href="<page docs/faq>"
            target="_blank">This Tor Project FAQ</a> has answers to all
            those questions, and more.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Does the Tor software work?</strong></p>
            <p>We believe Tor is the best solution available today,
            and we know that it does a better job of keeping you
            safely anonymous than other options such as VPNs,
            proxychains, or browser "private browsing" modes. We
            know that both the Russian government and the NSA
            have tried in the past to crack Tor, and failed. The
            Electronic Frontier Foundation says that Tor offers "<a
            href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/7-things-you-should-know-about-tor"
            target="_blank">some of the strongest anonymity software
            that exists</a>, and in his book Data and Goliath, security
            expert Bruce Schneier wrote "The current best tool to protect
            your anonymity when browsing the web is Tor."</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Is what Tor does legal? Can I get in trouble for
            using it?</strong></p>
            <p>Downloading the Tor browser or using the Tor network
            is legal in nearly every country. A few web sites
            occasionally block Tor, but that doesn't mean you're
            doing anything wrong. Usually it means that site has had
            difficulties with visitors who've been using Tor in the
            past, or that they misunderstand what Tor is and how it
            works (we’re working to change this). But it is not
            illegal to use Tor, and you shouldn't get in trouble for
            doing it. You can find more information about Tor's legal
            status <a href="https://www.eff.org/torchallenge/faq.html"
            target="_blank">on the EFF site</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Where can I find out more about the Tor Project,
            especially financial information?</strong></p>
            <p>Here are the Tor Project's <a
            href="<page about/financials>"
            target="_blank">financial statements, and its Form
            990</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Where does the Tor Project's money come
            from?</strong></p>
            <p>Tor is supported by United States government funding
            agencies, NGOs, private foundations, research institutions,
            private companies, and nearly 8,000 personal donations
            from people like you. The exact percentage varies by year,
            but in any given year, 80-90% of the Tor Project's funding
            comes from United States government funding sources. See
            <a href="<page about/sponsors>"
            target="_blank">https://www.torproject.org/about/sponsors</a>
            for more.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>How much money does the Tor Project spend annually,
            and what is it used for?</strong></p>
            <p>The Tor Project spends about $2.5 million annually. About
            80% of the Tor Project's spending goes on staffing, mostly
            software engineers. About 10% goes towards administrative
            costs such as accounting and legal costs and bank fees. The
            remaining 10% is spent on travel, meetings and conferences,
            which are important for Tor because the Tor community is
            global.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Is my donation tax-deductible?</strong></p>
            <p>If you pay taxes in the United States, your donation to
            Tor is tax deductible to the full extent required by law. The
            tax ID number for the Tor Project is 20-8096820.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>If I am not in the United States, can I still
            donate?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, definitely. Your donation probably isn't
            tax-deductible (unless you pay taxes on U.S. income) but we
            would very much appreciate your support. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Am I right that the Tor Project has never asked
            for donations before?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes! We've had a donate button on the site for years,
            and so far nearly 8,000 people have given money to the Tor
            Project. But this is the first time we've actively sought
            donations. To date, much of Tor Project funding has come
            from United States federal funding sources, such as the
            U.S. independent agency the International Broadcasting Bureau
            (IBB) and the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Democracy,
            Human Rights, and Labor (DRL). While we are grateful for
            this funding, we don't want the Tor Project to become too
            dependent on any single type of funding. Crowdfunding is
            unrestricted--It allows us to spend the money on the projects
            we think are most important and respond quickly to changing
            events.  And so, we are asking you to help financially support
            us, to increase the Tor Project's independence and ensure the
            sustainability of the products and services we provide.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Can I donate to a specific project, or restrict
            my donation to a particular purpose?</strong></p>
            <p>No, sorry. If we accept a donation from someone who has
            specified how they want it used, we're required by the IRS
            to track and report separately on that money. That would
            be a big administrative burden for a small organization,
            and we don't think it's a good idea for us. However, we
            would be very happy to hear your ideas and feedback about
            our work. If you're donating using a mechanism that allows
            for comments, feel free to send your thoughts that way.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Can I donate while using the Tor browser?</strong></p>
            <p>Maybe! In our testing, we saw two scenarios related to
            Paypal + Tor browser:<br />
            <ol>
              <li>Sometimes you get an error after clicking on the
              'Donate' button. If this is happening to you, you should
              change your circuit and try again.</li>
              <li>For users logging in to Paypal: some people had
              no problem donating via PayPal while using the Tor
              browser. But, some people couldn't complete the donation
              process, and one person had their PayPal account temporarily
              frozen. We recommend not using the Tor browser to donate
              using your PayPal account, unless you're willing to risk
              some difficulties with PayPal.</li>
              </ol></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>How can I donate via debit or credit card?</strong></p>
            <p>To donate using a major credit card or debit card (VISA,
            MasterCard, Discover or American Express) or via PayPal,
            please visit our donate page. You do not need to have a
            PayPal account to donate via credit card.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Why do you ask for my address and similar
            information?</strong></p>
            <p>If you donate by credit card, you will be asked for some
            information that's required to process your credit card
            payment, including your billing address. This allows our
            payment processor to verify your identity, process your
            payment, and prevent fraudulent charges to your credit
            card. We don't ask for information beyond what's required
            by the payment processor.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Why is there a minimum donation?</strong></p>
            <p>People who have stolen credit card information often
            donate to nonprofits as a way of testing whether the card
            works. These people typically use a very small amount for
            their testing, and we've found that setting a $1 minimum
            donation seems to deter them.</p>
          </li>  
          <li>
            <p><strong>Is there a maximum donation?</strong></p>
            <p>No, no, no! More funding from you means we can do more
            things we are excited to do, like hire a person to monitor
            the Tor network full time, or research, test, and  implement
            ideas we have for making  the Tor network even stronger.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Can I donate via bitcoin?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes! We accept <a
            href="<page donate/donate-options>"
            target="_blank">bitcoin via BitPay</a>.</p>
          </li>  
          <li>
            <p><strong>If I want my donation to be anonymous, what is
            the best way for me to donate?</strong></p>
            <p>You can donate by <a href="<page
            donate/donate-options>#cash">mailing cash</a>.
            You can donate via bitcoin
            if you have bitcoin set up in a way that preserves your
            anonymity. You can buy cash gift cards and mail them to
            us. There are probably other ways to donate anonymously that
            we haven't thought of-- maybe you will :)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Is the Tor Project required to identify me as
            a donor to the United States government, or to any other
            authority?</strong></p>
            <p>If you donate $5,000 or more to the Tor Project in a single
            year, we are required to report the donation amount and your
            name and address (if we have it) to the IRS, on Schedule
            B of the Form 990, which is filed annually. However,  it's
            normal for nonprofits to redact individual donor information
            from the copy of the 990 that's made publicly-available, and
            that's what we do. We are not required to identify donors to
            any other organization or authority, and we do not. (Also,
            if  you wanted, you could give us $4,999 in late 2015 and
            $4,999 in early 2016 ;)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>In your privacy policy, you say you will never
            publicly identify me as a donor without my permission. What
            does that mean?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, that's right. If you donate to the Tor Project, there
            will be some people at the Tor Project who know about your
            donation. However, we will never publicly identify you as
            a donor, unless you have given us permission to do so. That
            means we won't post your name on our website, thank you on
            Twitter, or do anything else that would publicly identify
            you as someone who has donated. If we decide we would like
            to publicly name you as a donor, we will ask you first,
            and will not do it until and unless you say it's okay.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>It's important to me that my donation be
            tax-deductible, but I don't pay taxes in the United
            States. </strong></p>
            <p>Right now, we can only offer tax-deductibility to
            donors who pay taxes in the United States. If it's
            important to you that your donations be tax-deductible
            in a different country, let us know and we will
            try to offer tax-deductibility in your country in
            future.  Or, if you are in Germany, France or Sweden, <a
            href="<page docs/faq>#RelayDonations"
            target="_blank">these organizations support the Tor
            network</a> and may be able to offer you tax-deductibility

          <li>
            <p><strong>What if I don't want to use PayPal? Is there
            another way I can donate? </strong></p>

            <p>If you want your donation refunded, please tell us
            by emailing donations(at)torproject.org. To process your
            refund we'll need to know the date of your donation, the
            amount you donated, your full name, the payment method you
            used and your country of origin. Please also tell us why
            you're asking for a refund. Please note that some payment
            methods won't support refunds, or require them to be made
            in a specific way, so we may need additional information
            from you in order to process yours.</p>

            <p><strong>Can I donate by mail?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes. Our mailing address is The Tor Project, 217 1st Ave S #4903,

            <p><strong>Do you accept cash donations?</strong></p>

          <li>
            <p><strong>Can I donate stock?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes! Many companies --such as Google, Microsoft, eBay,
            PayPal, Apple, Verizon, Red Hat, many universities,
            and others-- will match donations made by their
            employees. The fastest way to find out if your company
            matches donations is usually by checking with your
            HR department, or you can search for your company
            name at <a href="https://www.matchinggifts.com/rit/"
            target="_blank">https://www.matchinggifts.com/rit/</a>. If
            your company isn't currently set up to match donations
            to the Tor Project, we would be happy to help with the
            paperwork. If you want help figuring out the process, write
            us at donations(at)torproject.org.</p>

            <p><strong>Can I become a Tor Project member?</strong></p>
            <p>Right now, we don't have a membership program, but we may
            set one up in the future. If you want to get involved with
            the Tor Project, <a href="<page getinvolved/volunteer>">this
            is a good place to start</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>How can I get a Tor t-shirt or stickers?</strong></p>
            <p>If you donate $23 or more, you will get stickers we
            created just for this campaign. And if you donate $100 or
            more, you will get a special 'Tor supporter' t-shirt!</p>

            <p><strong>If I want to stay in touch with the Tor Project,
            what's the best way for me to do that?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Does the Tor Project participate in the Combined
            Federal Campaign program?</strong></p>
            <p>No, Tor doesn't currently participate in the CFC
            program. If you'd like to get Tor added to the CFC program
            in your location, that would be great: please let us know
            if you need any help. </p>

            <p><strong>Can I donate my airline miles, flight vouchers,
            or hotel points?</strong></p>
            <p>No, sorry. We would like to accept your miles, vouchers
            and hotel points, and in the future we may be able to.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Can I donate hardware?</strong></p>
            <p>Typically no, we don't encourage people to donate
            hardware. But if you want to make a hardware donation that
            you think might be especially useful for us, please mail
            donations(at)torproject.org.</p>

            <p><strong>I would like my company to support Tor. What can
            we do to help?</strong></p>
            <p>Your company could match donations made by its employees
            to the Tor Project--that would be wonderful. Your
            company may operate a corporate foundation that
            gives out grants, and if so, you should encourage it
            to fund us. Maybe your company would be willing to <a
            href="<page docs/faq>#HowDoIDecide"
            target="_blank">operate a Tor relay</a>. If your company
            sells cloud services, perhaps it could donate these to Tor:
            We use them in some anti-censorship projects.</p>

            <p><strong>You don't support my preferred way to donate. Can
            I recommend a new donation method to you?</strong></p>
            <p>Sure. Just mail us at donations(at)torproject.org.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Will the Tor Project accept donations from anybody,
            or do you reserve the right to reject support from specific
            organizations or individuals?</strong></p>
            <p>We do reserve the right to reject a donation. To date
            though, we haven't exercised that right. We are happy that
            a broad range of people use and support Tor.</p>

            <p><strong>I have more questions. How can I get

            <p>Feel free to send questions to
            donations(at)torproject.org. We will try to answer you,
            and we'll also post your question (and the answer) here.</p>
